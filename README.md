School project in three stages which helped in improving my OOP skills in Java (inheritance, interfaces, working with files/a data base).Â  I simulate services useful in an animal shelter, like: adding new animals, listing the existing animals in alphabetical order (with details such as age, weight, whether they are injured or not, a grade depending on the level of playfulness), generate CSV files for different actions (listing employees in alphabetical order, listing animals which are more likely to be adopted). In the final stage I created a data base using JDBC where I stored all the information about the animals and employees introduced using a form made with Swing. Using the data base I created services of adding, deleting and displaying animals and employees.
